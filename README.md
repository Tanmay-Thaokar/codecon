AI-Powered Legal Document Analyzer
aLegal documents are often long, complex, and filled with
jargon that makes them difficult to understand — especially
for non-lawyers. Reviewing contracts, agreements, and
policies manually is time-consuming and error-prone. Build
an AI-powered system that can analyze legal documents
and provide helpful insights such as summaries, keyword
highlights, risk detection, clause extraction, or even
simplified explanations. The system should help users —
legal professionals or laypersons — understand the
document more efficiently.
